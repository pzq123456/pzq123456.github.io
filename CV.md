I am an undergraduate student in [Shan Dong University of Science and Technology](https://en.sdust.edu.cn) at the [College of Geodesy and Geomatics](https://gc.sdust.edu.cn/). I am currently working on the topic of **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** (especially its application in **Web**). 3D WebGIS (WebGL) is my next topic to dive into.

* `TypeScript`: [RVGeo](https://github.com/pzq123456/RVGeo) --- A TypeScript library for spacial information analysis and visualization. 
  * For vector geographic data:
    * Implemented the functions of reading, parsing, storing and visualizing vector geographic data in GeoJSON format.
    * Using TypeScript to implement the conversion from geographic coordinates to Mercator coordinates ( EPSG:4326 -> EPSG:3857 ) and the measurement of the distance between two points on the Earth's surface.
    * Created a Voronoi diagram based on the Delaunay triangulation, which is based on the WGS84 coordinate system.
  * For raster geographic data (remote sensing images, DEM):
    * Implemented the functions of reading, parsing, visualizing raster geographic data in GeoTIFF format.
    * Implemented 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
  * Document:
    * The project has a matching [document website](https://pzq123456.github.io/RVGeo/), [example page](https://pzq123456.github.io/RVGeo/dist/index.html) and a simple tutorial [website](https://pzq123456.github.io/RVGeo/tutorials/index.html).

* `JavaScript`: [PzqCanvasTerminal](https://github.com/pzq123456/pzq123456.github.io) --- A terminal emulator based on HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JS. 
  * Using the design idea of data and view separation, the command auto-completion and blog address auto-completion functions are implemented by using the prefix tree.
  * Implemented the intelligent dialogue function by calling Gemini API.
