## Brief Introduction
<img src="../imgs/pzq.JPG" width="15%" height="15%" alt="avatar" style="margin-right: 10px; border-radius: 5%;">

I have a certain experience in WebGIS development, and I am familiar with programming languages such as **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **Python**. I am familiar with popular front-end toolchains and frameworks (**Node.js**, **Vite**, **Vue**, etc.), and have a strong ability in spatial data processing and visualization. In terms of WebGIS development, I focus on the implementation of spatial algorithms and the visualization of geographic information data on the browser side. At the same time, I have a certain research on the underlying principles of web map engines, familiar with concepts such as WebMercator projection, tiled maps, vector maps.

For GPS positioning principles and algorithms, I have systematically studied related courses during my undergraduate and master's courses. In particular, in the course, I have an understanding of the Android system [GNSS raw measurement data](https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/sensors/gnss?hl=zh-cn).
