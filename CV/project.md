# Project Guidance Request

Dear Professor Xintao Liu,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Zhiqing Pan](https://pzq123456.github.io/), and I am writing to formally express my interest in working on a project (LSGI552) under your supervision. After reviewing your research on urban computing platforms, I believe your guidance would be invaluable to my development and the success of the project.

My key projects include:

- WebGIS : 
  - [RVGeo](https://github.com/pzq123456/RVGeo), a TypeScript library for spacial information analysis and visualization([demo](https://pzq123456.github.io/RVGeo/dist/index.html)). 
  - [RVScripter](https://github.com/pzq123456/RVScripter), a web map rendering framework similar to Leaflet.js([demo](https://pzq123456.github.io/RVScripter/)).
- spatial data processing and visualization : [Shanghai Commuting Patterns Unveiled through Shared Bicycle Data](https://github.com/pzq123456/bike)

Please find my attached resume for further details. 

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Zhiqing Pan
