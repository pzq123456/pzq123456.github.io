I am an undergraduate student in [Shan Dong University of Science and Technology](https://en.sdust.edu.cn) at the [College of Geodesy and Geomatics](https://gc.sdust.edu.cn/). I am currently working on the topic of **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** and **Medical Image Auto Analysis Systems**. High-performance 3D terrain rendering is my next topic to dive into.
