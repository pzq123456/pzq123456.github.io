Everyone,

Happy New Year for 2025! 🎉🎉🎉

I have build a new website for my [RVGeo](https://pzq123456.github.io/RVGeo) library using the Vitepress framework. I also designed a new logo for RVGeo(with the help of Deepseek AI).

My Google Gemini API goes wrong those days. So the `chat` command in my terminal is not working now. I will try to fix it in the next few days.
